 # METHODS
 # Instance Methods
 ---
 _**Instance methods**_ are _functions_ that belong to instances of a particular class, structure, or enumeration. They support the functionality of those instances, either by providing ways to access and modify instance properties, or by providing functionality related to the instance’s purpose. Instance methods have exactly the same syntax as functions.
