 # CLOSURES
 # Escaping Closures
 ---
 A _closure_ is said to _**escape a function**_ when the _closure_ is passed as an argument to the function, but is called after the function returns. When you declare a function that takes a _closure_ as one of its parameters, you can write `@escaping` before the parameter’s type to indicate that the _closure_ is allowed to escape.
