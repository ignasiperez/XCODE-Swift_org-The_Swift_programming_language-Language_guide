 A `guard` statement, like an `if` statement, executes statements depending on the Boolean value of an expression. You use a `guard` statement to require that a condition must be true in order for the code after the `guard` statement to be executed. Unlike an `if` statement, a `guard` statement always has an `else` clause—the code inside the `else` clause is executed if the condition isn’t true.
