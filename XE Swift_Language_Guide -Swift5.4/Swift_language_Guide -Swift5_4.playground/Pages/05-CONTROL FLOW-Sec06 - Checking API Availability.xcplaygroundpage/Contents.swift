 # CONTROL FLOW
 # Checking API Availability
 ---
 Swift has built-in support for _**checking API availability**_, which ensures that you don’t accidentally use APIs that are unavailable on a given deployment target.

 The compiler uses availability information in the SDK to verify that all of the APIs used in your code are available on the deployment target specified by your project. Swift reports an error at compile time if you try to use an API that isn’t available.
