 # THE BASICS
 # Assertions and Preconditions
 ---
 _**Assertions and preconditions**_ are checks that happen at runtime. You use them to make sure an essential condition is satisfied before executing any further code. If the `Boolean` condition in the _assertion_ or _precondition_ evaluates to `true`, code execution continues as usual. If the condition evaluates to `false`, the current state of the program is invalid; code execution ends, and your app is terminated.

 You use _**assertions and preconditions**_ to express the assumptions you make and the expectations you have while coding, so you can include them as part of your code. _Assertions_ help you find mistakes and incorrect assumptions during development, and _preconditions_ help you detect issues in production.
