 # Stored Properties
 ---
 In its simplest form, a _**stored property**_ is a constant or variable that’s stored as part of an instance of a particular class or structure. _Stored properties_ can be either _**variable stored properties**_ (introduced by the var keyword) or _**constant stored properties**_ (introduced by the let keyword).
