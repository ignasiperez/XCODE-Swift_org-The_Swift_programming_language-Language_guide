 ## Floating-Point Numbers
 ---
 Floating-point numbers are numbers with a fractional component, such as 3.14159, 0.1, and -273.15.

 Floating-point types can represent a much wider range of values than integer types, and can store numbers that are much larger or smaller than can be stored in an Int. Swift provides two signed floating-point number types:

 + Double represents a 64-bit floating-point number.
 + Float represents a 32-bit floating-point number.
