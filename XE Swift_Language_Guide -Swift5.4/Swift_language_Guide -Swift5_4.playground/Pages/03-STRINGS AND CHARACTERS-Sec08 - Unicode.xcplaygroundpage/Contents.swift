 # STRINGS AND CHARACTERS
 # Unicode
 ---
 _**Unicode**_ is an international standard for encoding, representing, and processing text in different writing systems. It enables you to represent almost any character from any language in a standardized form, and to read and write those characters to and from an external source such as a text file or web page. Swift’s `String` and `Character types are fully Unicode-compliant, as described in this section.
