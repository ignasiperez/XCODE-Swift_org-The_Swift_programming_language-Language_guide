 # CLOSURES
 # Capturing Values
 ---
 A _closure_ can _**capture**_ constants and variables from the surrounding context in which it’s defined. The _closure_ can then refer to and modify the values of those constants and variables from within its body, even if the original scope that defined the constants and variables no longer exists.
