 _**Methods**_ are _functions_ that are associated with a particular type. Classes, structures, and enumerations can all define _instance methods_, which encapsulate specific tasks and functionality for working with an instance of a given type. Classes, structures, and enumerations can also define _**type methods**_, which are associated with the type itself. Type methods are similar to _class methods_ in Objective-C.
