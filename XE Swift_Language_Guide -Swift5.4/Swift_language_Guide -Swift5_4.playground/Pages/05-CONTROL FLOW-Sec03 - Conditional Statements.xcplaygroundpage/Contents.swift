 # While Loops
 ---
 A `while` loop performs a set of statements until a condition becomes false. These kinds of loops are best used when the number of iterations isn’t known before the first iteration begins. Swift provides two kinds of while loops:
 + `while` evaluates its condition at the start of each pass through the loop.
 + `repeat-while evaluates its condition at the end of each pass through the loop.
