 ## Semicolons
 ---
 Unlike many other languages, Swift doesn’t require you to write a semicolon (`;) after each statement in your code, although you can do so if you wish. However, semicolons are required if you want to write multiple separate statements on a single line:
 */
//: # [               􀄪   ](@previous) [   􀙋   ](_Cover%20page) [   􀄫](@next)
