 # THE BASICS
 # Semicolons
 ---
 Unlike many other languages, Swift doesn’t require you to write a _**semicolon**_ (`;`) after each statement in your code, although you can do so if you wish. However, _**semicolons**_ are required if you want to write multiple separate statements on a single line.
