 _Nested functions_, are a convenient means of naming and defining self-contained blocks of code as part of a larger function. However, it’s sometimes useful to write shorter versions of function-like constructs without a full declaration and name. This is particularly true when you work with functions or methods that take functions as one or more of their arguments.
