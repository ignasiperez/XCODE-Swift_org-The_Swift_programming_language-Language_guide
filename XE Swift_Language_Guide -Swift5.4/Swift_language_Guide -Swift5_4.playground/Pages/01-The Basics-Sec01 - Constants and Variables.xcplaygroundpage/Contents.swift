 ## Constants and Variables
 ---
Constants and variables associate a name (such as `maximumNumberOfLoginAttempts` or `welcomeMessage) with a value of a particular type (such as the number 10 or the string "Hello"). The value of a constant can’t be changed once it’s set, whereas a variable can be set to a different value in the future.
