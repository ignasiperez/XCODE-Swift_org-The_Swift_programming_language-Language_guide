 # The Basics
 # Constants and Variables
 ---
_**Constants and variables**_ associate a name (such as `maximumNumberOfLoginAttempts` or `welcomeMessage`) with a value of a particular type (such as the number 10 or the string "Hello"). The value of a _**constant**_ can’t be changed once it’s set, whereas a _**variable**_ can be set to a different value in the future.
