 ### 08 - Section 4
 # ENUMERATIONS
 # Associated Values
 ---
 The examples in the previous section show how the cases of an _enumeration_ are a defined (and typed) value in their own right. You can set a constant or variable to `Planet.earth`, and check for this value later. However, it’s sometimes useful to be able to store values of other types alongside these case values. This additional information is called an _**associated**_ value, and it varies each time you use that case as a value in your code.
