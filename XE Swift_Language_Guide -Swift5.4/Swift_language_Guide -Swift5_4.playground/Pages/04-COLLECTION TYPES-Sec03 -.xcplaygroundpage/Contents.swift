 # COLLECTION TYPES
 # Mutability of Collections
 ---
 If you create an array, a set, or a dictionary, and assign it to a variable, the collection that’s created will be mutable. This means that you can change (or mutate) the collection after it’s created by adding, removing, or changing items in the collection. If you assign an array, a set, or a dictionary to a constant, that collection is immutable, and its size and contents can’t be changed.
