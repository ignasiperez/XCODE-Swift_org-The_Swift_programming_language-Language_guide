 # CONTROL FLOW

 Swift provides a variety of _**control flow**_ statements. These include `while` loops to perform a task multiple times; `if`, `guard`, and `switch` statements to execute different branches of code based on certain conditions; and statements such as `break` and `continue` to transfer the flow of execution to another point in your code.
